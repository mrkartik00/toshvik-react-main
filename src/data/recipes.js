    ingredients: [
      { item: "Toshvik Atta", quantity: "2 cups" },
      { item: "Warm Water", quantity: "Approx. 1 cup" },
      { item: "Ghee or Oil (optional)", quantity: "1 tsp" },
      { item: "Salt (optional)", quantity: "A pinch" }
    ],
    instructions: [
      "In a large bowl, combine Toshvik Atta and salt (if using).",
      "Gradually add warm water, mixing to form a soft, pliable dough. The dough should not be sticky.",
      "Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.",
      "Add ghee or oil (if using) and knead for another minute.",
      "Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 20-30 minutes.",
      "Divide the dough into small, equal-sized balls (about lemon-sized).",
      "Dust a rolling surface with atta. Take one dough ball, flatten it, and roll it into a thin, even circle (about 6-7 inches in diameter).",
      "Heat a tawa (flat griddle) over medium-high heat.",
      "Place the rolled roti on the hot tawa. Cook for about 30-45 seconds or until tiny bubbles appear and the bottom is lightly cooked.",
      "Flip the roti and cook the other side for another 30-45 seconds.",
      "Using tongs, remove the roti from the tawa and place it directly over a medium flame (or on a wire rack over the flame). It should puff up into a ball within seconds.",
      "Flip and cook the other side on the flame for a few seconds until golden brown spots appear.",
      "Remove from flame, lightly brush with ghee (optional), and serve hot."

    tips: [
      "The consistency of the dough is key. It should be soft but not sticky.",
      "Resting the dough helps in making softer rotis.",
      "Ensure the tawa is sufficiently hot before placing the roti."

    ingredients: [
      { item: "Toshvik Atta", quantity: "2 cups" },
      { item: "Warm Water", quantity: "Approx. 1/2 to 3/4 cup" },
      { item: "Semolina (Sooji/Rava, optional for crispness)", quantity: "1 tbsp" },

      { item: "Salt", quantity: "1/2 tsp or to taste" },
      { item: "Oil", quantity: "For deep frying" }
    ],
    instructions: [
      "In a mixing bowl, combine Toshvik Atta, semolina (if using), and salt.",
      "Add 1 tbsp of oil or ghee to the flour mixture and mix well.",
      "Gradually add warm water and knead into a firm, yet smooth dough. The dough for pooris should be stiffer than roti dough.",
      "Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.",
      "After resting, knead the dough again for a minute. Divide it into small, equal-sized balls.",
      "Lightly grease your rolling surface and rolling pin with a bit of oil (avoid using dry flour for dusting pooris as it can burn in the oil).",
      "Take one dough ball and roll it into a small, even circle (about 3-4 inches in diameter). Don't roll them too thin.",
      "Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or deep pan over medium-high heat. To check if the oil is ready, drop a tiny piece of dough; it should rise to the surface quickly without changing color too fast.",
      "Gently slide one rolled poori into the hot oil. It will sink initially and then float up.",
      "Lightly press the poori with a slotted spoon to help it puff up. Splash some hot oil over it.",
      "Once puffed, flip the poori and cook the other side until golden brown (about 30-60 seconds per side).",
      "Remove the poori with a slotted spoon, allowing excess oil to drain, and place it on a plate lined with paper towels.",
      "Fry the remaining pooris in the same way. Serve hot with your favorite curry or sabzi."
    ],
    tips: [
        "Ensure the oil is at the right temperature; too hot and pooris will brown quickly without cooking, too cold and they will absorb excess oil.",
        "Roll pooris evenly for them to puff up well."
